udacity-web-dev-apps
====================

These are my working files for the Udacity Web Development course.
The following directories are deployable on the Google App Engine.

* hello: a simple http request program
* rot13: escapes user input and uses the ROT13 cipher to convert text input.
* signup: prompts for a username password and email (optional); escapes user
input and must validate all fields.
