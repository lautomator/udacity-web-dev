udacity-web-dev-apps
====================

These are my working files for the Udacity Web Development course.
The following directories are deployable on the Google App Engine.

To start the local app engine for testing use:

`dev_appserver.py <app dir/>`

* hello: a simple http request program
* rot13: escapes user input and uses the ROT13 cipher to convert text input.
* signup: prompts for a username password and email (optional); escapes user
input and must validate all fields.
* asciichan: make ascii art
* blog: a simple blog with authentication, user accounts, and API, and optimization
* wiki: the final project--allows you to create and edit web pages

Webapp2 documentation is [here](http://code.google.com/p/webapp-improved/).
